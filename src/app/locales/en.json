  "aboutText1": "Hi! I'm Bruna, but you can also call me Bru (that's a thing from São Paulo, right?!). London has always been my dream as a teenager, and in 2018, I was fortunate enough to make it come true. I moved here with my husband and daughter, and it was here that our family grew even more with the arrival of two more kids.",
  "aboutText2": "Since then, I've been looking for new experiences, and it was in this amazing city that I found the perfect setting to turn my passion into a profession. Photography has always been my great love, and my biggest wish is to capture special moments — just as my mother always did — because I believe everyone deserves to preserve unforgettable memories!",
